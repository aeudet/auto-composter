AUTO COMPOSTER is an automatic pop music composition tool. The program randomly generates a 'pop song', based around randomly generated song structure and chord progressions. The generated 'pop song' can be used as a base for a further realized song and fleshed out songs. This program takes the arbitrary and formal aspects of song writing and gives them up to chance, freeing the musician to focus on the more fun and less academic aspects of song writing like melody, tone, lyrics, and production; the 'pop song' can be interpreted in any way one wishes but if the basic structure is followed, the end result will be something like pop music.

EULA:

Make music. Any song you compose with the aid of this program is yours.
