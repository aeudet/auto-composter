AUTO COMPOSTER is an automatic pop song composition tool. The program randomly generates a 'song template' complete with a song structure and the nesessary chord progressions required for the song structure. The generated 'song template' can be used as a 'skeleton' for a further realized song. This takes the arbitrary and formal aspects of song writing and leaves them up to chance, freeing the user to focus on the more fun and personal aspects of song writing like melody, instrumentation, tone, lyrics, and production; or the aspects of song writing that gives songs there individual character. The 'song templates' can be interpreted in any way but if the basic structure is followed, the end result will be something of a pop song.
