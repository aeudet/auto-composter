AUTO COMPOSTER is an automatic pop music composition tool. The program randomly generates a 'pop song', built around randomly generated song structures and chord progressions. The generated 'pop song' can be used as a base for further realized songs. This program automates many of the more arbitrary and/or formal aspects of song writing freeing the musician to focus on the less formal aspects of song writing like melody, tone, lyrics, and production; the 'pop song' can be interpreted in any way one wishes but if the basic structure is followed, the end result will be something like pop music.
