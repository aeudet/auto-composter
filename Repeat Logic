REPEATS

We generate a repeat unique repeat value for each section of a song.

ex. (A B A C A)

Each section, even the multiple "A" sections get a unique repeat value. This value is printed at the end of each section.

THE LOGIC:

- First, we generate a base value. The value is selected from a container with numbers ranging from 2 to 24. The values will be weighted so the extreme ones are less frequent.


- Next, we look at how many bars long the progression is for that section of the song. If a progression is a low amount of bars within a certain range, we select from another container [Repeat_Modifier] with weighted values specific to that number of bars in progression.


- Finally, we take the [Base_Value] + [Repeat_Modifier] to get a [Total_Repeats]


Example:

Base value = 24
Repeat modifier = 8

[24] + [8] = 32
